# Development

## Virtual Environment

A virtual environment can be created to isolate the dev playground
from the rest of the workstation.

```
$ source ./qe-c-backlog-assistant.venv
```

The prompt shall indicate if the virtual environment was successfully
created.

Example:

```
(.qe-c-backlog-assistant_venv) me@myhost:~/qe-c-backlog-assistant [âš¡ master] $
```
